# LLM_RAG_satellite
Satellite Control System Development Plan
1. Project Overview

The goal is to develop a system integrating a custom large language model (LLM) with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to interface with and control satellite systems. The system leverages LangGraph for orchestration, AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 as the LLM, and Qdrant as the vector database.

2. System Architecture
```
LLM Backend: AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 for natural language processing and command generation.
RAG Pipeline: Combines retrieval from Qdrant vector database with LLM to provide context-aware responses.
Orchestration: LangGraph prebuilt ReAct agent to manage workflow, decision-making, and tool invocation.
API Layer: FastAPI backend to handle requests, integrate components, and interface with satellite systems.
Vector Database: Qdrant for storing and retrieving satellite-related documents and metadata.
Satellite Interface: Placeholder functions simulating satellite control (e.g., telemetry retrieval, command execution).
Configuration: Parameters stored in a .env file for flexibility (e.g., AWS credentials, Qdrant URL, API keys).
```
3. Development Phases

Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

Set up FastAPI project structure with .env for configuration.
Configure AWS Bedrock client for Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2.
Initialize Qdrant vector database with sample satellite data (e.g., telemetry formats, command protocols).
Install LangGraph and dependencies for ReAct agent.

Phase 2: RAG Pipeline Development

Create document ingestion pipeline to populate Qdrant with satellite-related data (e.g., manuals, telemetry logs).
Implement embedding generation using AWS Bedrock embeddings API.
Develop retrieval logic to fetch relevant documents based on user queries.
Integrate RAG with Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 for contextual response generation.

Phase 3: Satellite Interface (Placeholder)

Define placeholder functions for satellite operations (e.g., retrieve_telemetry, send_command).
Simulate satellite responses with mock data (e.g., JSON telemetry outputs).
Ensure functions are callable by LangGraph agent.

Phase 4: LangGraph Orchestration

Configure LangGraph ReAct agent to process user inputs and orchestrate tasks.
Define tools for retrieval (Qdrant), LLM inference (AWS Bedrock), and satellite control (placeholder functions).
Implement workflow to handle queries, retrieve context, generate responses, and execute commands.

Phase 5: FastAPI Backend

Develop API endpoints for user interaction (e.g., /query, /command).
Integrate LangGraph agent with FastAPI to process requests.
Implement error handling and logging.
Secure API with environment-based API keys.

Phase 6: Testing and Validation

Test RAG pipeline with sample queries (e.g., "retrieve satellite health status").
Validate LangGraph agentâ€™s decision-making and tool invocation.
Simulate satellite control scenarios using placeholder functions.
Ensure .env parameters can be updated without code changes.

4. Tools and Technologies

```
Programming: Python, FastAPI
LLM: AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2
Vector Database: Qdrant
Orchestration: LangGraph (ReAct agent)
Configuration: python-dotenv for .env management
Dependencies: boto3 (AWS SDK), qdrant-client, langgraph
```

5. Milestones

```
Week 1-2: Environment setup, Qdrant initialization, AWS Bedrock integration.
Week 3-4: RAG pipeline and placeholder satellite functions.
Week 5-6: LangGraph agent setup and FastAPI backend development.
Week 7: Testing, validation, and documentation.
Week 8: Final refinements and deployment preparation.
```

6. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: AWS Bedrock latency or quota limits.
Mitigation: Implement caching and optimize API calls.


Risk: Qdrant scalability for large datasets.
Mitigation: Optimize indexing and use efficient embeddings.


Risk: Placeholder functions not representative of real satellite systems.
Mitigation: Design flexible interfaces for future integration.



7. Future Enhancements

Replace placeholder functions with real satellite control APIs.
Add real-time telemetry streaming.
Enhance RAG with domain-specific fine-tuning of embeddings.
